1. what is != and where should you use it?

    # this is a logical operator. It means not equal, and you would use it to compare.

2, put ! before something, like !user_name

    # assigns the value not to the variable

3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!

    This will change a non mutating method into a mutating method in certain cases.
    It is part of the method name and is undetermined without testing or reading the docs.
    
4. put ? before something
  
    # This is used in ternary if/else statements ? :
    
5. put ? after something

    # This is commonly used in methods to identify that the method returns a boolean.
    # But that is a style choice, not Ruby Syntax.
    
6. put !! before something, like !!user_name

    # !!<some object> is used to turn any object into their boolean equivalent. (Try it in irb)
